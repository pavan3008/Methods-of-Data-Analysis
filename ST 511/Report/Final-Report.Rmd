## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
data <- read.csv("ds_salaries.csv")

```
```{r}

ggplot(data, aes(x=company_size, y=salary_in_usd)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "red", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(y = "Salary (in USD)", x = "Company Size") +
  theme_bw() + 
  ggtitle("Salary (in USD) based on the size of company")
```

## Histogram

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = salary_in_usd)) +
  geom_histogram( binwidth = 20000, color = "black", alpha = 0.5, fill = "red") +
  ggtitle("Data Science Job Salaries (2020 - 2022) ") + xlab("Salary (in USD)")
  
```

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = salary_in_usd)) +
  geom_histogram( binwidth = 20000, color = "black", alpha = 0.5, fill = "red") +
  ggtitle("Data Science Job Salaries (2020 - 2022) ") + xlab("Salary (in USD)") +
  facet_wrap(~company_size, ncol = 1)
```

## Anova

```{r}
anova(lm(salary_in_usd ~ company_size, data=data))

```


## Krushkals

```{r}
anova(lm(salary_in_usd ~ (company_size == "S"), data = data))

```

## Including Plots
```{r}

size <- data$company_size
sal <- data$salary_in_usd
ggplot(data, aes(x = sal )) + geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = "30") +
facet_wrap(~size, ncol = 2)

ggplot(data, aes(x = salary_in_usd)) +
  geom_histogram( binwidth = 20000, color = "black", alpha = 0.5, fill = "red") +
  ggtitle("Data Science Job Salaries (2020 - 2022) ") + xlab("Salary (in USD)") 
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
